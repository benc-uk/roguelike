Nothing more to say here until there's a working prototype üòä

## Adjunct Side-Side Project Ideas

Ideas for spin off side projects

### Sprite Editor

A separate sprite editor has been developed to aid with creating sprites, it's pure a HTML/JS web app currently contained as a sub-project in this repo

### Sound Effect Engine

Make my own, 8 bit SID like sound engine?

### Music mod player

Make my own? (Probably not, [you've been here before](https://github.com/benc-uk/nanotracker) Ben)
